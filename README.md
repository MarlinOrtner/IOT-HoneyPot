## M5Stack NanoC6 ESP32 Honeypot

<img alt="logo" src="./m5nanohoney.png" width="33%" height="33%"/>
  
This project is a standalone Multi-port honeypot for NanoC6 and ESP32 platform. It emulates a realistic Linux shell environment on telnet and multiple port banner to attract and analyze unauthorized access attempts. It features a full web-based configuration UI, persistent storage using SPIFFS, and webhook-based alerting that can be integrated with Discord, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or SIEM platforms like ELK.
  
  Here the demo video on Evil-Cardputer:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Flash this firmware on any ESP32 using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
2. On first boot, ESP32 will create a Wi-Fi access point:
   - SSID: HoneypotConfig
   - Password: HoneyPotConfig123
3. Connect and open `http://192.168.4.1` to configure
4. After saving the configuration, the ESP32 will reboot and connect to your Wi-Fi
5. Telnet honeypot starts on port 23, listening for attackers
6. All captured inputs will be logged and optionally sent to your webhook

If the AP is not near it, mode configuration is enabled and web portal is accessible.

Note : NanoC6 can be put in configuration mode by olding the button when the white light is ON at boot.

## üì¶ Dependencies

- ESPAsyncWebServer
- ArduinoJson
- SPIFFS (built-in)
- WiFi (built-in)

Make sure to install the required libraries via Library Manager or PlatformIO.

---

## üìÅ SPIFFS Structure

/config.json       ‚Üí Contains Wi-Fi and webhook settings  
/honeypot_logs.txt ‚Üí Stores captured login attempts and commands  
/index.html        ‚Üí Web-based configuration UI  

All files are automatically created at first boot if missing.

---

## üì° Webhook Format

Example payload (JSON, sent as POST):

{
  "content": "üì° Honeypot\nüîç IP: 192.168.1.5\nüíª Command: `cat /etc/passwd`"
}

You can route this to:

- Discord (via Webhook URL)
- Telegram (via Bot API Gateway)
- Signal (via relay server or bridge)
- WhatsApp (via Business API)
- SIEMs or custom log collectors

---

## üß† Emulated Commands

Basic commands:
- pwd, whoami, uptime, hostname, uname -a, id, lscpu, df -h, free -h, env, set, history

Filesystem:
- ls, ls -l, cd, cat, mkdir, rm, rmdir, touch, chmod, chown

Networking:
- ifconfig, ip addr, ping, netstat -an, curl, wget

Services:
- service <name> start/stop/status
- systemctl status/start/stop

Package manager:

## üõ°Ô∏è Usage Notes

This honeypot is designed for educational and defensive cybersecurity purposes. Do not expose to the internet without proper upstream firewalling or network segmentation. It is not intended to replace full honeynet frameworks like Cowrie, but serves as a lightweight ESP32-based trap canary.
